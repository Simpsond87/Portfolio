                <p>My name is Daniel Simpson, and I love programming. I am from South Carolina and have lived there my whole life. I have a Bechelor's degree in Math/Computer Science, and have applied my knowledge personally and professionally toward the end goal of becomming a competent computer scientist. My interests lie mainly in web development. I enjoy seeing an idea come to life on screen in a way that is interactive and eye-catching. I also like to play billiards, piano, and the Chinese board game of "Go"... as well as cook, read, write fiction, and drink coffee. I hope you appreciate my portfolio, and I'll see you in the forums!</p>
